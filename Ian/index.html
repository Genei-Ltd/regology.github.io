The lack of sophistication on the part of many of the public concerning an athletic trainer’s services, the importance of the interests affected by the choice of an athletic trainer and the foreseeable consequences of unrestricted advertising by athletic trainers which is recognized to pose special possibilities for deception, require that special care be taken by athletic trainers to avoid misleading the public. The athletic trainer must be mindful that the benefits of advertising depend upon its reliability and accuracy. Since advertising by athletic trainers is calculated and not spontaneous, reasonable regulation designed to foster compliance with appropriate standards serves the public interest without impeding the flow of useful, meaningful, and relevant information to the public. </div></li><li style="list-style-type: '(2)   ';"><div><span>Definitions </span><ul><li style="list-style-type: '(a)   ';"><div>Advertisement. Informational communication to the public in any manner designed to attract public attention to the practice of an athletic trainer who is licensed to practice in Tennessee. </div></li><li style="list-style-type: '(b)   ';"><div>Licensee. Any person holding a license to practice as an athletic trainer in the State of Tennessee. Where applicable this shall include partnerships and/or corporations. </div></li><li style="list-style-type: '(c)   ';"><div>Material Fact. Any fact which an ordinary reasonable and prudent person would need to know or rely upon in order to make an informed decision concerning the choice of practitioners to serve his or her particular needs. </div></li><li style="list-style-type: '(d)   ';"><div>Bait and Switch Advertising. An alluring but insincere offer to sell a product or service which the advertiser in truth does not intend or want to sell. Its purpose is to switch consumers from buying the advertised service or merchandise, in order to sell something else, usually for a higher fee or on a basis more advantageous to the advertiser. </div></li><li style="list-style-type: '(e)   ';"><div>Discounted Fee. Shall mean a fee offered or charged by a person for a product or service that is less than the fee the person or organization usually offers or charges for the product or service. Products or services expressly offered free of charge shall not be deemed to be offered at a "discounted fee." </div></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: '(3)   ';"><div><span>Advertising Fees and Services </span><ul><li style="list-style-type: '(a)   ';"><div>Fixed Fees.

It is presumed unless otherwise stated in the advertisement that a fixed fee for a service shall include the cost of all professional recognized components within generally accepted standards that are required to complete the service. </div></li><li style="list-style-type: '(b)   ';"><div>Range of Fees. A range of fees may be advertised for services and the advertisement must disclose the factors used in determining the actual fee necessary to prevent deception of the public. </div></li><li style="list-style-type: '(c)   ';"><div><span>Discount Fees. Discount fees may be advertised if: </span><ul><li style="list-style-type: '1.
