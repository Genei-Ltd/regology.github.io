FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW </h1><p>The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the entry of this Consent Order and that there is no just reason for delay.  The Court therefore directs the entry of the following Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, permanent injunction, and equitable relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2018), as set forth herein. </p><h2>A. Findings of Fact </h2><h3>The Parties to this Consent Order  </h3><ul><li><span>15. </span><span>Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the independent federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act and the Regulations. </span></li><li><span>16. </span><span>Defendant HDR Global Trading Limited was incorporated in the Seychelles in 2014 as a Seychelles International Business Company.  From no later than November 2014 through at least October 1, 2020 (the “Relevant Period”), HDR has owned and operated the BitMEX trading platform.  “HDR” derives from the first letter of the last names of Hayes, Delo, and Reed, who are the three primary ultimate owners of HDR and its various subsidiaries, each holding approximately a one-third ownership interest in HDR.  HDR has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. </span></li><li><span>17. </span><span>Defendant 100x Holdings Limited holds itself out as “the holding group for HDR Global Trading Limited and its assets, including the BitMEX platform, and [BitMEX’s] team of best-in-class professionals in finance, web development, and high frequency algorithmic trading.”  100x has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. </span></li><li><span>18. </span><span>Defendant ABS Global Trading Limited is a Delaware limited liability company incorporated in 2017 through which BitMEX has conducted certain operations in the United States.  ABS is a subsidiary of HDR.  ABS has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. </span></li><li><span>19. </span><span>Defendant Shine Effort Inc Limited is a Hong Kong limited liability company incorporated in 2014, and a subsidiary of HDR.  During the Relevant Period, Shine was the corporate entity through which BitMEX conducted proprietary trading on its own BitMEX platform.  Shine has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. </span></li><li><span>20. </span><span>Defendant HDR Global Services (Bermuda) Limited is a Bermudian limited liability company incorporated in 2018 that employs certain personnel performing duties for BitMEX.  HDR Services has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.  </span></li></ul><h3>The BitMEX Trading Platform and Products </h3><ul><li><span>21. </span><span>BitMEX is a peer-to-peer “crypto-products platform” that offers the trading of cryptocurrency derivatives, including derivatives on bitcoin, ether, and litecoin.   </span></li><li><span>22. </span><span>Throughout the Relevant Period, BitMEX operated as a common enterprise through a number of affiliated entities, including Settling Defendants HDR, ABS, Shine, and HDR Services, acting through their officers, agents, or employees. </span></li><li><span>23. </span><span><span>During the Relevant Period, BitMEX offered leveraged trading of cryptocurrency derivatives to retail (non-eligible contract participants (“non-ECPs”)) and institutional customers </span><span>in the U.S. and throughout the world through BitMEX’s website, (&lt;http:www.bitmex.com&gt;)www.bitmex.com, the BitMEX mobile application, and by direct connection to its trading engine servers via the BitMEX application programming interface (“API”).  Customers in the U.S. placed orders to buy or sell contracts directly through BitMEX’s user interfaces, including the website and API.  During the Relevant Period, BitMEX acted as the counterparty to certain transactions on its platform. </span></span></li><li><span>24. </span><span>On May 13, 2016, BitMEX launched its first swap product, a “perpetual bitcoin U.S. dollar leveraged swap product.”  On its website, BitMEX has described its “Perpetual Contract” (or “perpetual swap contract”) as “a product similar to a traditional Futures Contract in how it trades.” </span></li><li><span>25. </span><span>Throughout the Relevant Period, BitMEX conducted certain components of its business and maintained a presence in the U.S., including maintaining an office in New York from late 2017 until early 2019 and establishing a San Francisco office in 2017.   </span></li><li><span>26. </span><span>During the Relevant Period, BitMEX solicited orders from U.S.-based customers for futures, options, and swaps through its website and on social media.  The BitMEX website and social media were available to and accessed by U.S.-based customers.  </span></li><li><span>27. </span><span>Throughout the Relevant Period, BitMEX’s U.S. customers were able to access the BitMEX platform from the U.S.—either via API or through the BitMEX website accessed on customers’ own computers located in the U.S. via a virtual private network (“VPN”).  BitMEX was aware that U.S. customers used VPNs to access the BitMEX platform.  </span></li><li><span>28. </span><span>During the Relevant Period, BitMEX offered, entered into, confirmed the execution of, and otherwise conducted activities relating to commodity option transactions in interstate commerce.  These transactions were not executed on any registered board of trade, nor was BitMEX registered as a foreign board of trade. </span></li><li><span>29. </span><span>During the Relevant Period, BitMEX solicited or accepted orders for the purchase or sale of commodities for future delivery; engaged in soliciting or accepting orders for swaps; engaged in soliciting or accepting orders for retail commodity transactions, and/or acted as a counterparty to those transactions; and, in connection with these activities, accepted money, securities, or property, including bitcoin, to margin, guarantee, or secure resulting trades on the BitMEX platform.  In accordance with Section 1(a)(47)(iii) and (vi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1a(47) (iii), (vi) (2018), the swaps solicited or accepted by BitMEX included “perpetual swaps” or “perpetual contracts” on bitcoin, ether, and litecoin.  During the Relevant Period, BitMEX operated a facility for the trading of swaps—that is, a trading system or platform in which more than one market participant has the ability to execute or trade swaps with more than one other market participant on the system or platform—on digital assets including bitcoin, ether, and litecoin without registering with the CFTC as a designated contract market or a swap execution facility. </span></li><li><span>30. </span><span>During the Relevant Period, BitMEX employed an inadequate supervisory system and failed to perform its supervisory duties diligently.  Among other things, BitMEX failed to implement a customer identification program (“CIP”), including know-your-customer (“KYC”) procedures, that would enable it to identify U.S. persons using the BitMEX platform—or determine the true identity of the vast majority of its customers, whether from the U.S. or elsewhere.  BitMEX also failed to implement an adequate anti-money laundering (“AML”) program, which is required to prevent or detect, among other things, terrorist financing or other criminal activity, and failed to implement procedures to determine whether a customer appears on lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations such as those issued by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”).   </span></li><li><span>31. </span><span>BitMEX represents it has engaged in remedial measures, including the development of an AML program and user verification program.  BitMEX has accelerated the implementation of its enhanced internal controls designed to detect and prevent suspicious transactions, such as the controls embedded in its user verification program; verified the identities of all active users of its platform as of December 2020; appointed a Chief Compliance Officer and hired new AML-dedicated compliance staff; and engaged an outside consultant to conduct reviews and independent testing of BitMEX’s AML program, CIP, and KYC policies and procedures. </span></li></ul><h2>B. Conclusions of Law </h2><h3>Jurisdiction and Venue </h3><ul><li><span>32. </span><span>This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2018) (codifying federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2018) (providing that U.S. district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress).
