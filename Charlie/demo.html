INTRODUCTION </h1><p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that since becoming provisionally registered as swap dealers, Credit Suisse International, Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited, and Credit Suisse Capital LLC (collectively “Credit Suisse” or “Respondents”), violated Section 2(a)(13)(F) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(13)(F) (2018), and Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 45.4(d)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 45.4(d)(2) (2020).  Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondents engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions. </p><p>In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.  Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”) and acknowledge service of this Order.1 </p><h1>II. FINDINGS </h1><p>The Commission finds the following: </p><h2>A. SUMMARY </h2><p>Reporting is at the heart of the Commission’s market and financial surveillance programs, which are critical to the Commission’s mission to protect market participants and promote market integrity, and helps it to fulfill its Congressional mandate of monitoring for systemic risk.  Accurate swap data is essential to effective fulfillment of the regulatory functions of the Commission, including meaningful surveillance and enforcement programs. </p><p>As provisionally-registered swap dealers (“SDs”), Respondents were required to comply with certain reporting requirements related to their swap transactions.  Since becoming provisionally registered SDs, Respondents failed to accurately report certain data to a swap data repository (“SDR”) under Part 45 of the Regulations, 17 C.F.R. pt. 45 (2020).  Specifically, from at least January 10, 20132 to December 2018 (the “Relevant Period”), one or more Respondents submitted inaccurate daily valuation data for the majority of their equity swap transactions.  </p><h2>B. RESPONDENTS </h2><p>Credit Suisse International is a provisionally-registered SD since December 31, 2012, based in London, United Kingdom.  It is an exempt foreign firm pursuant to Regulation 30.10, 17 C.F.R. § 30.10 (2020).   </p><p>Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited is a provisionally-registered SD since July 1, 2013, based in London, United Kingdom.  It is an exempt foreign firm pursuant to Regulation 30.10. </p><p>Credit Suisse Capital LLC is a provisionally-registered SD since August 15, 2017, based in New York City.  </p><h2>C. FACTS </h2><p><span>As provisionally-registered SDs, Respondents are reporting counterparties pursuant to the Act and Regulations, and thus are required to report certain data relating to swap transactions, including the accurate daily value of the swap, to an SDR.  However, during the Relevant Period, one or more Respondents inaccurately reported particular swap data under Part 45 of the </span><span>Regulations.  Specifically, when reporting certain equity swap transactions to the SDR, Respondents failed to comply with the requirement that they report the “daily mark” of these swap transactions.  Instead, Respondents reported the mark-to-market notional value of the underlying equity.  This valuation reporting error impacted approximately 91 percent of Respondents’ reportable equity swap positions, and 14 percent of their overall reportable swaps, during the Relevant Period.  This reporting error, which was caused by a single issue in the reporting engine used by Respondents, also impacted approximately 22 million messages to the SDR. </span></p><p>Respondents discovered the reporting error in October 2018.  Respondents have represented that they remediated the reporting error by mid-December 2018, and that their reporting of the daily valuation field for equity swaps was accurate from that date onward. Respondents have further represented that they corrected the historical record of all inaccurate reports by August 18, 2020. </p><h1>III. LEGAL DISCUSSION </h1><p>The Act states that, with regard to real-time data, “[p]arties to a swap . . . shall be responsible for reporting swap transaction information to the appropriate registered entity in a timely manner as may be prescribed by the Commission.”  Section 2(a)(13)(F) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(13)(F) (2018).  Regulation 45.4(d)(2) requires that “valuation data for a swap must be reported by” an SD to an SDR on a “daily” basis.  17 C.F.R. § 45.4(d)(2) (2020).3 Regulation 45.1 defines “[v]aluation data” as “all of the data elements necessary to fully describe the daily mark of the transaction …”  17 C.F.R. § 45.1 (2020).4  In this case, Respondents failed to report the “daily mark” for certain identified equity swaps transactions.    </p><p>“The accuracy and completeness of swap reporting are critical to the Commission’s mission to protect market participants and to ensure market integrity.”  U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Deutsche Bank AG, No. 1:16-cv-6544 (WHP), 2020 WL 4611985, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June 17, 2020) (consent order) (citing In re Société Généralé Int’l Ltd., CFTC No. 19-38, 2019 WL 4915485, at *6 (Sept. 30, 2019) (consent order) (collecting cases).  The Commission requires complete and accurate reporting data to engage in meaningful oversight of the swaps market.  Id. </p><p>As set forth above, Respondents failed to accurately report certain swap data.  As a result, Respondents violated Section 2(a)(13)(F) of the Act and Regulation 45.4(d)(2).  </p><h1>IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS </h1><p>Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondents violated Section 2(a)(13)(F) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(13)(F) (2018), and Regulation 45.4(d)(2), 17 C.F.R.  § 45.4 (2020).   </p><h1>V.
