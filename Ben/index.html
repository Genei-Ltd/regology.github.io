        <h1>OFAC Enters Into $1,385,901.40 Settlement with Payoneer Inc. for Apparent Violations of Multiple Sanctions
            Programs </h1>
        <p>Payoneer Inc. (“Payoneer”), a publicly traded New York-based online money transmitter and provider of prepaid
            access, has agreed to remit $1,385,901.40 to settle its potential civil liability for 2,220 apparent
            violations of multiple sanctions programs. Payoneer processed 2,201 payments for parties located in certain
            jurisdictions and regions subject to sanctions including the Crimea region of Ukraine, Iran, Sudan, and
            Syria, and 19 payments on behalf of sanctioned persons on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and
            Blocked Persons (“SDN List”). Payoneer’s sanctions compliance program deficiencies at the relevant
            times—including with respect to screening, testing, auditing, and transaction review procedures—enabled
            persons in these jurisdictions and regions and on the SDN List to engage in approximately $793,950.70 worth
            of transactions. The settlement amount reflects OFAC’s determination that 2,201 of Payoneer’s apparent
            violations were not voluntarily self-disclosed, 19 were voluntarily self-disclosed, and all transactions
            were non-egregious. </p>

        <h1>Description of the Conduct Leading to the Apparent Violations </h1>
        <p>Between February 4, 2013 and February 20, 2018, Payoneer processed 2,220 transactions totaling $793,950.70 in
            apparent violation of multiple OFAC-administered sanctions programs (the “Apparent Violations”). Payoneer’s
            policies and procedures dating back as far as June 2015 specified that transactions involving parties in
            sanctioned locations were prohibited, but the testing and auditing conducted to verify that these policies
            and procedures were being implemented failed to identify the compliance deficiencies that led to the
            Apparent Violations. </p>
        <p>The Apparent Violations, which related to commercial transactions processed by Payoneer on behalf of its
            corporate customers and card-issuing financial institutions, resulted from multiple sanctions compliance
            control breakdowns, including (i) weak algorithms that allowed close matches to SDN List entries not to be
            flagged by its filter, (ii) failure to screen for Business Identifier Codes (BICs) even when SDN List
            entries contained them, (iii) during backlog periods, allowing flagged and pended payments to be
            automatically released without review, and (iv) lack of focus on sanctioned locations, especially Crimea,
            because it was not monitoring IP addresses or flagging addresses in sanctioned locations. </p>
        <p><span>These compliance deficiencies resulted in apparent violations of Section 1(a)(iii) and Section 2 of
                Executive Order 13685 of December 19, 2014, “Blocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting
                Certain Transactions with Respect to the Crimea Region of Ukraine”; the Zimbabwe Sanctions Regulations,
                31 C.F.R. § 541.201; the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. §
                544.201; the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. § 560.204; the now-repealed
                Sudanese Sanctions Regulations (SSR), 31 C.F.R. § </span><span>538.205;1 (&lt;&gt;)and the Syrian
                Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. § 542.207. </span></p>

        <h1>Penalty Calculation and General Factors Analysis </h1>
        <p>The statutory maximum civil monetary penalty applicable in this matter is $654,357,316. OFAC determined that
            2,201 of the Apparent Violations were not voluntarily self-disclosed, 19 were voluntarily self-disclosed,
            and all were non-egregious. Accordingly, under OFAC’s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines
            (“Enforcement Guidelines”), the base civil monetary penalty amount applicable in this matter is $3,849,726.
            The settlement amount of $1,385,901.40 reflects OFAC’s consideration of the General Factors under the
            Enforcement Guidelines. </p>
        <p>OFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>1) </span><span>Payoneer failed to exercise a minimal degree of caution or care for its sanctions
                    compliance obligations when it allowed persons on the SDN List and persons in sanctioned locations
                    to open accounts and transact as a result of deficient sanctions compliance processes that persisted
                    for a number of years; </span></li>
            <li><span>2) </span><span>Payoneer had reason to know the location of the users it subsequently identified
                    as located in jurisdictions and regions subject to sanctions based on common indicators of location
                    within its possession, including billing, shipping, or IP addresses, or copies of identification
                    issued in jurisdictions and regions subject to sanctions; and </span></li>
            <li><span>3) </span><span>The Apparent Violations caused harm to six different sanctions programs. </span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>OFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>1) </span><span>Upon discovering potential sanctions compliance issues, senior management acted
                    quickly to self-disclose the Apparent Violations related to blocked persons and provided substantial
                    cooperation throughout the investigation; </span></li>
            <li><span>2) </span><span>Payoneer has not received a penalty notice or Finding of Violation from OFAC in
                    the five years preceding the date of the earliest transaction giving rise to the Apparent
                    Violations; </span></li>
            <li><span>3) </span><span><span>Payoneer has represented that it has terminated the conduct that led to the
                        Apparent Violations and undertook the following remedial measures intended to minimize the risk
                        of recurrence of similar conduct in the future: </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>• </span><span>Replacing its Chief Compliance Officer, retraining all compliance
                                employees, and hiring new compliance positions focused specifically on testing; </span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>• </span><span>Enhancing its screening software to include financial institution alias
                                names and BIC codes and automatically triggering a manual review of payments or accounts
                                that match persons on the SDN List; </span></li>
                        <li><span>• </span><span>Enabling the screening of names, shipping and billing addresses, and IP
                                information associated with account holders to identify jurisdictions and regions
                                subject to sanctions; </span></li>
                        <li><span>• </span><span>Pending transactions flagged by its filter instead of allowing them to
                                complete during a backlog; and </span></li>
                        <li><span>• </span><span>A daily review of identification documents uploaded to Payoneer, and a
                                rule engine that stops payments with identification indicating jurisdictions and regions
                                subject to sanctions. </span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            <li><span>4) </span><span>As part of its agreement with OFAC, Payoneer has undertaken to continue its
                    implementation of these and other compliance commitments. </span></li>

        <h1>Compliance Considerations </h1>
        <p><span><a>Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments </a></span>This action highlights that money services
            businesses—like all financial service providers—are responsible for ensuring that they do not engage in
            unauthorized transactions prohibited by OFAC sanctions, such as dealings with blocked persons or property,
            or engaging in prohibited trade-related transactions with jurisdictions and regions subject to sanctions. To
            mitigate such risks, money services businesses should develop a tailored, risk-based sanctions compliance
            program. OFAC’s notes that each risk-based sanctions compliance program will vary depending on a variety of
            factors, including the company’s size and sophistication, products and services, customers and
            counterparties, and geographic locations, but should be predicated on and incorporate at least five
            essential components of compliance: (1) management commitment; (2) risk assessment; (3) internal controls;
            (4) testing and auditing; and (5) training. </p>
        <p>Within that framework, this enforcement action emphasizes the importance of effective screening not only for
            persons on the SDN List but also for sanctioned locations; ensuring that audits of OFAC compliance programs
            focus not only on persons on the SDN List but also on sanctioned locations; performing algorithm testing to
            be sure filters are flagging payments within expected parameters; screening for BIC codes, especially when
            OFAC includes them in SDN List entries; and holding flagged payments until they have been reviewed. </p>

        <h1>OFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources </h1>
        <p><span><a>A Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments </a></span>On May 2, 2019, OFAC published in order to
            provide organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, as well as foreign entities that conduct business in or
            with the United States or U.S. persons, or that use U.S.-origin goods or services, with OFAC’s perspective
            on the essential components of a sanctions compliance program. The Framework also outlines how OFAC may
            incorporate these components into its evaluation of apparent violations and resolution of investigations
            resulting in settlements. The Framework </p>
        <p>includes an appendix that offers a brief analysis of some of the root causes of apparent violations of U.S.
            economic and trade sanctions programs OFAC has identified during its investigative process. </p>
